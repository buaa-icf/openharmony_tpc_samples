## POP3

### Introduction

This project provides an email client that supports the POP3 protocol. It allows the client to log in to or log out of a mailbox, obtain the email list, obtain email details, and delete emails.

## How to Install

```shell
ohpm install @ohos/node-pop3 
```

For details about the OpenHarmony ohpm environment configuration, see [OpenHarmony HAR](https://gitee.com/openharmony-tpc/docs/blob/master/OpenHarmony_har_usage.en.md).

## How to Use

Note: Globally search *xxx* in the project and replace them with the actual email address and account password.

#### Importing the Library

```
import Pop3Command from '@ohos/node-pop3'
```

#### Initializing Request Parameters

```typescript
 let option = {
    host: `pop.qq.com`, // Adjust the value based on the mailbox type, for example, pop.163.com or pop.126.com.
    port: 110, // If tls is false, use port 110. If tls is true, use port 995.
    user: 'xxx@qq.com', // Enter the actual email address, which must be the same as the email address type of the host.
    password: 'xxxxxx', // Pay attention to the rules for distinguishing different email addresses. Some email addresses use the account and password, and others use the authorization code.
    timeout: 30000,
    servername: `pop.qq.com`, // The value must be the same as host.
    tls: false, // Set this parameter to false for encryption purposes.
    tlsOptions: undefined // This parameter must be set when tls is true. The type is TLSConnectOptions of the @ohos.net.socket module.
  }
```

#### Initializing the Client

```typescript
 let client = new Pop3Command(option);
```

The request process is encapsulated in the library. You can directly call commands to perform related operations without login.

#### Checking the Connection with the Server

```typescript
 await client.NOOP()
 console.log(`pop3---NOOP executed successfully --->`)
```

#### Obtaining All Unread Emails in the Mailbox

```typescript
let result = await client.STAT()
console.log(`pop3---STAT executed successfully --->${result}`)
```

If there are unread emails in the mailbox, two parts are returned, separated by spaces. The first part indicates the number of unread emails, and the second part indicates the total number of bytes of unread emails.

#### Obtaining the Email List

```typescript
let result = await client.LIST()
console.log(`pop3---LIST executed successfully --->`)
```

If there are unread emails in the mailbox, two parts are returned, separated by the comma (,), for each unread email. The odd number indicates the email sequence number, and the even number indicates the number of bytes of the email.

#### Obtaining Email Details

```typescript
 let result = awaitclient.RETR(this.selectMsgNum + '')
```

The parameter is the email sequence number. The obtained response result is encoded and needs to be parsed.

#### Obtaining the First Several Lines of an Email

```typescript
 let result = await client.TOP(this.selectMsgNum + '', parseInt(this.topLine))
```

The parameters are the email sequence number and topLine. The obtained response result is encoded and needs to be parsed.

#### Adding a DELE Flag to an Email

```typescript
 let result = await client.DELE(this.selectMsgNum + '')
```

After a DELE flag is added to an email, the email is not deleted immediately. It is deleted only after the QUIT command is called.

#### Logout

```typescript
 const [quitInfo] = await client.QUIT();
```

Log out and delete the email with the DELE tag.
